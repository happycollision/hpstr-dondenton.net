I visited my girlfriend's hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee for New Year's. I had only been there once before, and it was not a trip where I really got to enjoy the city. She took me to see the sights while I was there, and I also got to meet her grandfather.

He was a wonderful man and I had a great time talking with him and sharing stories. I do plan on seeing him again before long when I go back to visit, but I had no real expectation to communicate with him in between visits. Until of course the all-encompassing, all-devouring Facebook stepped in.

I got a message from my girlfriend tonight that he joined and she gave me the nickname he is using "if you wanna friend him."

Well, of course I did.

He joked a bit about how he would regret this, and asked if there was something similar to Facebook for people like him, an "antisocial media" thing. That made me laugh, and inspired a 15 minute little project I could do while taking a break from other work.

It's a bit of a gag, and I hope it makes you chuckle. But it probably won't.
