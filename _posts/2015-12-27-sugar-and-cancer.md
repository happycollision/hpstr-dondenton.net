This is one of the most fascinating podcast episodes I have ever listened to.

One interesting moment in particular---as someone whose roommate survived cancer and chemotherapy---was when Doctor Seyfried discussed the notion that targeting cancer's main source of fuel (glucose) could be just as effective as chemotherapy. So *cutting out sugars* from someone's diet could *prolong or save their life* without destroying their quality of life.

Check out the podcast from either [their page](http://vinnietortorich.com/2015/12/sugar-and-cancer/) or from [Overcast.fm](https://overcast.fm/+B08Xt_8vM), which has a very nice, easy player.
