# What do I even do?

I am an actor with a technical bent. I play around [on stage](http://dondentonactor.com) and I play around [on computers](http://github.com/happycollision).

I am also passionate about [health and wellness](http://dondenton.yoli.com/my-story/).

# Why this site?

I like the idea of having a space for my thoughts that is open and available to anyone. Facebook is a nice start for sharing the everyday things, but they can do whatever they want with people's content. And sometimes, [they do horrible things](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/30/facebook-sad-manipulating-emotions-socially-responsible-company) with it. So this site is just for me.
